# *Smart Directory Management System*
A Python-based directory management tool that organizes files, detects duplicates, and provides undo functionality, all through an intuitive Tkinter-based GUI.

*Features*  
- **File Categorization:** Automatically categorizes files into folders such as "Images," "Documents," "Videos," and more.  
- **Duplicate Detection:** Finds duplicate files based on their SHA256 hash values.  
- **Undo Functionality:** Allows undoing the last file organization operation, reverting files to their original locations.  
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built using Tkinter, the GUI allows users to easily scan directories, organize files, and manage duplicates.  

*Technologies Used*
- *Python*
- *Tkinter:* For building the graphical user interface.  
- *Hashlib:* For generating file hashes and detecting duplicates.  
- *OS and Shutil:* For file and directory management.  
- *PIL (Pillow):* For handling image metadata (if needed).  
- *Magic Library (python-magic):* For MIME type detection.

*How to Use the Application*  

1. *Scan a Directory:*
   - Select the folder you want to organize and click the **"Scan"** button to analyze its contents.  

2. *Organize Files:*
   - Once the directory is scanned, click **"Organize"** to categorize files into folders (Images, Documents, etc.).  

3. *Undo Last Action:*  
   - Accidentally moved the files to new folders? No worries! Click **"Undo"** to revert the last file organization action.  

4. *Detect Duplicates:*  
   - Use the **"Find Duplicates"** button to search for duplicate files in the scanned directory. You can then delete the duplicates if desired.  

5. *Preview Changes (Optional):*  
   - Before organizing files, click **"Preview Changes"** to see how the files will be reorganized.
